# Classifying-Wine-Type-using-Physicochemical-Properties
Wine has a wide variety of physicochemical properties that differ with grape type, fermentation process, and age. These properties are used to classify wine quality and type. One of these properties is chloride content, the amount of salt in wine. It tends to be higher in red wine due to the extraction of the grape skin during fermentation (https://www.awri.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/s1530.pdf). Another property is total sulfur dioxide, which tends to be higher in white wine to prevent it from browning and microbe spoilage. The northwestern Portuguese wine, Vinho Verde, has red and white variants. With greater volumes, classifying wine type has become increasingly important in certifying and selling the wines (https://www.winesofportugal.info/pagina.php?codNode=3889). Hence the question: Based on chloride and total sulfur dioxide content, can we predict the wine type (red or white) of an unspecified Vinho Verde wine?
